	About Premier Technical Sales
</h1>
<p>
	Premier Technical Sales is one of the leading technical Field Representatives in the South West.
	Originally founded under Youngewirth and Olenick, we have been servicing Commercial, Medical,
	Military and Space customers in the AZ/NM territory for over 21 years. As you will see, the
	companies we represent are all complimentary with each other, which is one of the keys to our
	success. This allows for incredible lead generation, as well as being laser focused on the
	entire system block diagram and not just one portion. We pride ourselves on not only having in
	depth knowledge of the products we represent, but our customer needs as well. Premier works with
	our Principals and OEM Engineers from conceptual designs through production. We have worked very
	hard to build up the reputation of being one of the best in our fields and thus how we came up
	with the name PREMIER.

		<p>
			I started my career in RF/Microwave in 1984, while working with Integrated Microwave
			(IMC) as a Engineer Technician. After three years, I moved into Sales Manager roll (with
			IMC) and managed all of the Reps nation-wide until 1990. I was then recruited by Piezo
			Technology to be their Director of Sales for the Western Region, where again I managed
			Reps for an additional 4 years and successfully grew our business. Opened Y&O AZ
			(covering AZ/NM) in 1994 to Jan 1st of 2016. I have now purchased the AZ/NM territory
			from Y&O, while still maintaining the same list of Principals.

			I have spent 9 years doing customer service related work in a broad capacity. I started
			going to school for Nursing, then quickly realized that’s not what I wanted to pursue. I
			then met Jeff and was very interested in hearing what he did for work. I am now proud to
			say I work for Jeff Beard and I’m excited to continue my professional career working for
			Premier Technical Sales extending my knowledge and growth in the field.
