	About Premier Technical Sales
</h1>
<p>
	Premier Technical Sales is one of the leading Technical Field Representatives in the Southwest.
	We have been servicing the Commercial, Military, Space and Medical markets for over 25 years. As
	you will see, the companies we represent synergize with each other, which is one of the
	foundations to our success. This allows for incredible lead generation, as well as being laser
	focused on the entire system block diagram. We pride ourselves on having an in-depth knowledge
	of the products as well as our customers needs. Premier works with our Principals and OEM
	Engineers from conceptual designs through production. We have worked very hard to build up the
	reputation of being one of the best in our field and thus how we landed on the name Premier.

		<p>
			I started my career in RF/Microwave in 1984, while working with Integrated Microwave
			(IMC) as a Engineer Technician. After three years, I moved into Sales Manager roll (with
			IMC) and managed all of the Reps nation-wide until 1990. I was then recruited by Piezo
			Technology to be their Director of Sales for the Western Region, where again I managed
			Reps for an additional 4 years and successfully grew our business. Opened Youngworth &
			Olenick AZ (covering AZ/NM) in 1994 to Jan 1st of 2016. I have now purchased the AZ/NM
			territory from Y&O, while still maintaining the same list of Principals.
